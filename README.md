# Etch-a-Sketch

A browser based Etch-a-Sketch program! This project is given as a part of The Odin Project. The goal here is to put the foundational javascript learned in the previous lessons to practice. Similarly I also tried to make it at least _slightly_ visually appealing with the HTML and CSS. 


## Thoughts

- Getting the 'feel' of the application right was my focus on this project. Rather than use hover to color divs I preferred the method of click-dragging. This required a bit more research but nothing too insane. 
- I decided to implement the shading portion of the extra-credit options and not the rainbow pen. The largest percentage of overall time probably went into getting this just how I wanted it.

### For the future
---
I plan on revisiting most if not all of these programs at some point after I complete the course. For this project in particular, I want it to be fully-functional on mobile. Also probably some reorginizations/cleaning of the code.
